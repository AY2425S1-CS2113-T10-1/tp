## Overview

EasInternship is a desktop tracking application used for tracking internship applications along the various stages
of an application. The user interacts with it using a CLI and the application is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Summary of Contributions

- **New Feature:** Added the ability to filter internship entries.
    - What it does: Allows the user to filter internship entries by various fields such as role name, company name, internship duration, and favorite status. Users can specify multiple filter flags simultaneously, with case-insensitive search for role and company name.
    - Justification: Users often need to view only specific internship applications matching particular criteria, such as role type, company, or timeframe. This feature provides flexibility in managing and narrowing down the list of internships based on user preferences.
    - Highlights: This feature required a detailed understanding of handling multiple parameters and developing an intuitive syntax for users. It involved implementing logical checks for multiple filtering conditions and managing default values for fields if no specific values are provided.

- **New Feature:** Added the ability to mark internships as favorites.
    - What it does: Enables users to mark specific internships as a "Favorite" by entering the internship ID. This helps users easily identify important or preferred internships.
    - Justification: Users may want to flag certain internships to easily return to them, especially if they are in later stages of the application process or hold particular interest. Favoriting helps users keep track of high-priority applications without searching through the entire list.
    - Highlights: The implementation involved managing user input for single or multiple IDs in a single command, ensuring flexibility in the favorite marking process. Plans are in place to expand functionality to allow removal of the favorite status in future versions.
