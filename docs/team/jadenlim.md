## Overview

EasInternship is a desktop tracking application used for tracking internship applications along the various stages
of an application. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Summary of Contributions

- **New Feature:** Added the ability to add an internship entry.
  - What it does: Allows the user to add a new internship entry
  - Justification: Applicants might be applying to multiple companies and hence it can aid the user in tracking their multiple applications
  - Highlights: This enhancement affects both the `InternshipList` and `Internship` class, requiring a careful analysis
    on the methods to implement in each class, as well as the `Exceptions` to be handled on each level. The
    implementation also has to be constantly updated when new fields are added to the internship entries.
